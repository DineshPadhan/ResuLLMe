üëâ Check some sample r√©sum√©s generated by ResuLLMe ([1](./.github/samples/Simple.pdf), [2](./.github/samples/Alta.pdf), [3](./.github/samples/Awesome.pdf))

## üöÄ Concept


ResuLLMe is an AI-powered app that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to help you generate, edit, and tailor professional r√©sum√©s. It is like a smart career advisor to check and improve your r√©sum√©.

**Project Status:**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The deployed version of ResuLLMe currently has issues with PDF generation due to platform limitations. **We recommend running the app locally for the best experience and full PDF functionality.**

This project is an updated and enhanced version of the original [ResuLLMe by IvanIsCoding](https://github.com/IvanIsCoding/ResuLLMe), with new features, improved workflows, and a modernized user experience. See [DineshPadhan/ResuLLMe](https://github.com/DineshPadhan/ResuLLMe) for the latest code and updates.

## üõ† How It Works

## ‚ú® Key Features (Enhanced Version)
- Modernized UI with Streamlit multipage navigation
- Interactive template gallery with previews
- Form-based and Overleaf-like LaTeX editing
- AI-powered section editing for education, work, skills, projects, and awards
- Live PDF preview and download (fully supported in local mode)
- Support for OpenAI, Gemini, and self-hosted LLMs
- Improved error handling and user guidance

ResuLLMe receives your previous CV as a PDF or Word Document. Then, it uses LLMs to:
- Improve the r√©sum√© following published r√©sum√© guidelines by well-reputed schools
- Convert the r√©sum√© to a JSON Resume format
- Render the JSON resume using LaTeX to generate a new PDF of the enhanced resume


> [!NOTE]
> ResuLLMe was updated to support macOS and Windows. For that to happen, we had to switch the LaTeX engine. If you prefer the old rendering behavior, check the code in the `v1` branch.


> [!TIP]
> If ResuLLMe fails to extract data from your CV, you can manually download the JSON output, edit it, and re-render at the "Render JSON Resume" tab.

## üèÉ Running Natively


To run the app locally, you will need to install [Pixi](https://prefix.dev/):

```
curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
```

Lastly, to run ResuLLMe locally, execute:

```
pixi run run-app
```

This will make the app available at [`http://localhost:8501/`](http://localhost:8501/)

### ü™Ñ Running with Docker

To run ResuLLMe locally, the simplest way is to use Docker:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will make the app available at [`http://localhost:8501/`](http://localhost:8501/)
